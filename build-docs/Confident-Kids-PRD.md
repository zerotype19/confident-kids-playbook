# Confident Kids Playbook â€“ Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. App Overview

The Confident Kids Playbook is a web-based app designed to help parents raise confident, resilient children through a structured system of daily challenges, guided journaling, and skill-building exercises. The app is modeled after the "Raising Confident Kids" playbook and delivers practical tools grounded in five core pillars: Independence, Growth Mindset, Social Confidence, Purpose Discovery, and Managing Fear & Anxiety.

It is optimized for mobile and built with a clean, informal design aesthetic. The MVP will be web-first (Cloudflare Pages + Workers), with plans to support multi-parent collaboration, premium feature gating via Stripe, and progressive content delivery.

## 2. User Flows

Users land on the homepage and are prompted to sign in via Google OAuth. Once authenticated, onboarding begins by asking the user to create a child profile. Each authenticated user becomes part of a family group. Families can have multiple children and multiple parent users.

From there, the primary experience is:
- **Daily Challenge Delivery**: The app presents a confidence-building challenge per day.
- **Response & Reflection**: Parents mark completion and optionally journal thoughts or upload a related photo/note.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users see streaks, history, and stats in a dashboard.
- **Access to Practice Modules**: Deeper training modules are unlocked to reinforce key parenting themes.
- **Calendar/Planner**: Users can look ahead or reflect back on previous challenges.

Users on a free tier see limited challenge history and modules. Premium users unlock full journaling, all practice modules, and historical data.
